## DRACULA OS 🧛🏻‍♀️ 
Dracula OS is a Linux operating system meticulously designed for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and Cyber ​​Intelligence missions.
Distinguished by its use of Kali Linux's vast repositories, Dracula OS enriches its arsenal with an exclusive selection of OSINT tools sourced from GitHub. 
This initiative aims to forge a platform supremely fitted for the discerning demands of cyber intelligence professionals and enthusiasts alike, providing a direct import OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) file for effortless deployment and operation.

The inception of Dracula OS sprang from the ambition to create a specialized toolset that seamlessly merges the comprehensive capabilities of Kali Linux with the precise requirements of the OSINT community. 
The result is a sophisticated operating system that not only harnesses Kali Linux's extensive suite of tools but also integrates a carefully chosen collection of OSINT applications from the vibrant GitHub community.

Dracula OS is inspired by and seeks to contribute to the legacy of pioneering projects like Trace Labs VM and CyberPunkOS, aiming to push the boundaries of what is possible in cyber intelligence and open-source intelligence gathering.
